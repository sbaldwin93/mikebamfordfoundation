		<h4 class="fix">The one message we had in our lives while Mike was fighting for his life, was this – Never Give Up. Mike lived this way through and through. It was in him, day after day, day in, day out. When I didn’t think I could do or take another day – Mike would be the one who set the tone for the rest of us; signaling that he was still in it. He amazed all of us with his strength and perseverance. For having lain in bed for most of 16 months, Mike’s body was still strong, pulling from deep within to do what his doctors, therapists, nurses and others asked of him. Can I tell you his will to live was even stronger?</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">I wasn’t sure about whether God would grant us the wonder of healing and the burning wish to keep Mike and take him home – to start our lives again. And because of this unknown, unanswered prayer, I sometimes wondered if Mike wanted to give up. I even asked him if he thought about Heaven, all in an attempt to take his temperature on what he was thinking, where his heart was with all the sickness and discouragements he faced. He didn’t hesitate in answering me, “of course I do, mom.” But very quickly upon his answer, he asked me why was I asking him this. I knew he was not going to have me talking about going to Heaven when he planned on living. From then on, it was about living – not because we were pretending, but because that is how Mike lived. No faking it here.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">This brings us to you.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">It is our hope that we can draw inspiration and more from Mike’s legacy of never wanting to give up and passing that on to you. We have had to find a way to move along. I could say “move on,” but I don’t think that that really ever happens. We move along, wanting the days ahead to hold promise for a future, a hope, a place of destiny that fulfills the passion we have to honor Mike in the creation of this foundation.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">I write from a heart filled with two years of unbearable pain. It has not been easy, pretty or presentable – more honestly, it’s been ugly.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">But I can tell you it gets better.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">No matter what the reason for the visit to our website; know this, we want you to leave this page knowing you can see light somewhere on the horizon. A glimmer of light will do – take it, it will become brighter.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">For us, our Mike did not want to give up. His body did. His spirit was willing to fight.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">Now it is our will that musters the strength to fight, to live Mike’s words spoken to his dad: “I never want to give up.”</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">I’ve learned to concentrate on what these words mean, on the message we included in our mission statement:</h4>
		<h4 class="fix"><strong>Never Give Up</strong></h4>

		<h4 class="fix">Your Faith,</h4>

		<h4 class="fix">All of these reasons, together, bring new life.</h4>
