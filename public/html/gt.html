		<h4 class="fix">The Mike Bamford Foundation Memorial Golf Tournament is traditionally held each year to raise funds to support all of the Foundation’s programs. This year we were unable to organize the tournament due to scheduling conflicts, but we plan on being back in 2016 with a tournament that’s bigger and better than ever. We’re currently working on the schedule for our 2016 tournament and will post the date soon.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">Thank you so very much for your support and we look forward to seeing you next year!</h4>
