		<h4 class="fix">The Mike Bamford Foundation M-Prints Pendant Program was created to comfort grieving families with a lasting memorial to the life of their child. Pressed in fine silver, the child’s thumbprint is captured on a pendant which can be hung on a chain and held near to the heart for years to come.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">These pendants will be available at Children’s Hospital in Colorado. Two gift pendants will be given to the family of a terminally ill child on the Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders floor. Additional pendants may also be purchased, the proceeds of which will go to support the pendant program.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">Our family shares the joy of crafting your pendants. We enjoy crafting each one, taking our time to ensure you will be happy. Thank you for trusting us with such an honorable job. We love dPendant-pic-with-natoing this!</h4>
