		<h2 class="titles">Children's Hospital Colorado</h2>
		<h4 class="fix">Because we know from experience the financial difficulties that grieving families face, our most important mission is to help ease the burden of a long and difficult hospital stay. Your donations go to the Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at Children’s Hospital and are directed to help provide meals, lodging, transportation and other necessities to families who are most in need. In addition, the Foundation helps to fund cystic fibrosis research at the Mike McMorris Cystic Fibrosis Center at Children’s Hospital.</h4>
		<h2 class="titles">Cancer Prom</h2>
		<h4 class="fix">The Cancer Prom for the Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders gives teens the opportunity to enjoy a prom experience with other teens fighting or who have survived cancer. Mike attended his only prom in 2010 with his sister, Natalie as his date. Looking back, we are so glad we made the extra trip to Denver so that Mike could dress up, dance and laugh the night away.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">A portion of the donations made to the Mike Bamford Foundation are given to help support other families with travel and lodging expenses so that they, too, will have this fun-filled experience with their child.</h4>

		<h2 class="titles">Beads of Courage</h2>
		<h4 class="fix">The foundation supports the Beads of Courage program with a donation that will take them into 2015. This resilience-based interventional program is designed to support and strengthen children and families coping with serious illness. Through the program children tell their story using colorful beads as meaningful symbols of courage that commemorate milestones they have achieved along their unique treatment path.</h4>
		<h2 class="titles">Scholarships</h2>
		<h4 class="fix">In honor of Mike and his love of golf, the foundation awards scholarships each year to a graduating senior from Mesa County who best exhibits the qualities of his character: courage, grace, compassion, perseverance and strength in the face of adversity. Each recipient is awarded $1,000 to help them pursue a college education and their love for the game.</h4>
