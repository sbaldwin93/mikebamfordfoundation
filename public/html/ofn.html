		<h4 class="fix">This picture that you see, reflects our family, our dogs included, without our beloved Mike. Before cancer struck, we were a family of four, only different faces filled the picture. I have had a song playing through my head leading up to this new introduction. It’s by Crosby, Stills, and Nash – maybe you have heard it.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">“Our house, is a very, very, very fine house</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">With two cats in the yard</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">Life used to be so hard, now everything</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">Is easy because of you…..”</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">I think the song runs through my head for I am always thinking of my home, our house, and life before and after cancer struck our lives. It is something we all think about isn’t it? Going home, seeing our family, eating dinner, throwing the ball in the backyard, watching movies, eating popcorn, planting flowers, fluffing the pillows on the couch, hoping to relax and enjoy each other’s company.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">Our network of friends and community have supported us the last three years by supporting the start-up of our foundation and embracing our desire to help families whose children are suffering with cystic fibrosis along with the families whose children are terminally ill with cancer.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">To combine two very difficult diseases into a mission statement, to define who we support and why, has not been easy. Mike had both cystic fibrosis and leukemia – both deserving of our time and energy, resources and fundraising. Families deserve all we can do for them, supporting them when they are at their worst – emotionally and a lot of times financially. We strive to become stronger and stronger in our efforts to raise funds to help them and others that will come along. We continually look at ourselves and where we are headed; fully committed to improving what we are doing, serving and comforting families as we, ourselves, journey through this life, moving along, into a world of new beginnings.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">Beginnings all of you have made easier…</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">To close this introduction, the fourth person in our family picture is Luke Clayton, our new son-in-law. He married Natalie on June 2nd of last year in a beautiful evening ceremony. We are a family of four, but really, there are still five of us. Mike will always be present in our hearts, carrying on with us wherever this takes us.</h4>
