		<h4 class="fix">The Mike Bamford Foundation was created to honor Mike’s passion for life and his heroic efforts in the fight against three terminal illnesses. Together our family took up the fight to see Mike survive; inspired by his deep well of hope and belief he would win over cancer. We have been forever impacted by the lengthy fight Mike courageously fought, his passing, and now the re-building of our lives. We set forth to raise funds for families just like us; using these funds to ease their difficult hospital stays; fund research, comfort grieving parents and siblings, and to send our personal message to never give up.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">In addition, The Mike Bamford Foundation created the M-Prints Pendant Program that funds the making of fine silver pendants. Our daughter, Natalie, made us fingerprint pendants early on in our trek with cancer. We did not realize the importance or impact they would have on our lives. We wanted others to have what we had. We have made them available to families of terminally ill children at Children’s Hospital Colorado – Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders floor. Our pendants feature the child’s fingerprint pressed in fine silver to produce a beautiful impression that will be treasured for a lifetime.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">The Mike Bamford Memorial Golf Tournament was established to honor Mike’s love of golf. Funds will allow us to award a scholarship each year to a graduating senior from Mesa County. Recipients will be chosen from those who exhibit Mike’s traits of strength, courage, perseverance, compassion and faith. The tournaments are held every year to raise funds for all of the foundation’s giving.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">When we started our trek through the stupid cancer maze, I tagged a quote from Winston Churchill: “Never, never, never, never give up.” I felt the “will power” of these words fit Mike, although Mike didn’t know I selected this quote for him. Mike not only lived this way; but in his own words he said: “I never want to give up.” We have taken his words as our own, and use them as we work toward assisting those families fighting right now.</h4>
		<h4 class="fix">Thank you for your support and encouragement. Your donations inspire us to carry on Mike’s legacy to never give up. It is because of you that we do what we do – turning our loss into gain – for the benefit of others.</h4>
